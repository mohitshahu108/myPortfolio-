        <h4>About</h4>
        <p class="size-large">Hi, Iâ€™m Mohit Shahu.</p>
        <p>
          You can also call me a product designer, front-end developer, music
          enthusiast, traveler, photographer and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I donâ€™t like to define myself by the work Iâ€™ve done. I define myself
          by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is
          inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and
          do interesting things that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, Iâ€™m easily
          inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they
          take me. Iâ€™m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a
          natural ability to entertain and inspire. Iâ€™m never satisfied to just
          come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies,
          areas of study and artistic endeavors. Iâ€™m a fast learner, able to
          pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with
          relative ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my
          life and career. My personality type is . I currently work remotely
          with a selected freelance client base and are open for new
          opportunities.
        </p>
